        my favorite part of patino is the environment. the school has a sense of togetherness and its safe. another thing i like is the campus because it clean and new.

        my least favorite part of patino is that we are all in one space all the time. the seniors dont leave the senior space all day except for electives. i also dont like the scrum boards we use in the senior space.
